instructions for setting up and running a Python FastAPI project with a recommendation API using a pre-trained ReBERTa base model from Hugging Face. I'll help you refine the provided instructions and create a standard README.md file.

# Recommendation API with FastAPI and ReBERTa

## Introduction ( Running Api locally without GPU for testing)

This project demonstrates a recommendation API developed with Python FastAPI, utilizing the ReBERTa base model. To run this API locally without requiring significant hardware resources, we leverage Hugging Face's hosted API for the ReBERTa model.

## Installation

Install the required libraries by running the following commands:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn requests
```

## Getting Started

1. Go to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) and create an account to obtain an API key (it's free).

2. Open the `video_recomend_api_QA_R_model.py` file and replace `'api key'` in the following line with your obtained API key:

    ```python
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {'api key'}"}
    ```

3. Save the file.

4. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the folder containing `video_recomend_api_QA_R_model.py`.

5. Start the FastAPI server with the following command:

    ```bash
    uvicorn video_recomend_api_QA_R_model:app --reload
    ```

6. This will start the server and display a URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000`). Copy this URL.

7. Open a web browser and paste the copied URL. Change the URL to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`. This will open the Swagger API documentation page.

8. You can now enter a question and the API will provide a related video link.

## Notes

- The ReBERTa base model is not implemented in this script locally due to high resource requirements. Instead, it is accessed via Hugging Face's hosted API.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) for providing the hosted API for the ReBERTa model.

Please make sure to replace `'api key'` in the instructions with appropriate formatting indicating where the actual API key should be placed. If you have any specific questions or further requests, feel free to let me know!
